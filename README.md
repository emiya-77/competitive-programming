## Learning and Reflections

In this section, I'll share some of the key learnings and reflections on the problems I've solved:

### What Iâ€™ve Learned:

- **Dynamic Programming**: Understanding how to break down problems into subproblems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Learning to make the best choice at each step.
- **Graph Theory**: Mastering different traversal techniques like DFS and BFS.

### Challenges Faced:

- **Time Complexity**: Struggling with optimizing solutions to fit within time limits.
- **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases in problems that are easy to overlook.

### Goals:

- Solve at least one problem every day.
- Improve time complexity analysis.
- Participate in more live contests.
